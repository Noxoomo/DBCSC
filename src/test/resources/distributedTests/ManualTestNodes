Three node test.To manual network test put  in nodesN - config for nodes and database, in client - client config

Node and client akka config. Put this into file akka for nodes, for client just provide path as second argument:

akka {
     loglevel = "DEBUG"
     actor {
      provider = "akka.remote.RemoteActorRefProvider"
     }
     remote {
      transport = "akka.remote.netty.NettyRemoteTransport"
      log-sent-messages = on
      log-received-messages = on
      netty.tcp {
        hostname = "127.0.0.1"
        #should be different for each node, if run on the same machine
        port = 2511
      }
server {
# The port clients should connect to. Default is 2552 (AKKA)
port = 2610
}
     }
}

To config client to connect to running nodes:
provide to client as a first run argument path to file with nodes:
In each line â€“ one node, for example:

akka.tcp://Node@127.0.0.1:2511/user/Storage
akka.tcp://Node@127.0.0.1:2512/user/Storage
akka.tcp://Node@127.0.0.1:2513/user/Storage
